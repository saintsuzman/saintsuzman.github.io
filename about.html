      <h2>Our Courage Apostolate</h2>
        <p>Courage members are men and women who experience same-sex attractions and who have made a commitment to strive for chastity. They are inspired by the Gospel call to holiness and the Catholic Church’s beautiful teachings about the goodness and inherent purpose of human sexuality.

Through our apostolate, people who experience same-sex attraction receive pastoral support in the form of spiritual guidance, community prayer support, and fellowship</p>

      <h2>Our Encourage Apostolate</h2>
        <p>EnCourage members are parents, spouses, sibling and friends of people who identify as LGBTQ+. They are looking for help to keep the faith and keep their family bonds intact.

EnCourage members work together to understand the experiences of their loved ones, and to respond to them with compassion. They know that it is possible to express love for someone even if we can’t support all of their choices or actions. They find spiritual guidance to grow in their relationship with Christ, and community support from other members that helps them remember that they are not alone on this journey.</p>
